### Usage Tips
 - Automatic wallpaper changer is only available to pro users and can be found inside collections.
 - The option to enable automatic wallpaper changer is only available upon adding atleast 2 images to collection.
 - Create your own assorted collection of wallpapers so that automatic wallpaper changer can cycle through them periodically after the      time interval (default - 30 mins) set by you.
 - You can reorder images in collection by holding down an image and then dragging and dropping it to the desired location.
 - Clearing the app by swiping from recent apps screen might lead to the automatic wallpaper changer malfunctioning.
 - If WallR does not show a notification stating that automatic wallpaper changer then please restart the app so that automatic            wallpaper changer can be restarted by the app itself.
 
### Project Setup Notes
- The google-services.json file has been purposely ignored by git due to security purposes. Please login to <a href="https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/?gclid=CjwKCAjw__fnBRANEiwAuFxET6VRIbt1VaeN3D_DAYAU3rAwAC1uJGY1FaKZvmWSTe8bkiGe8lRAPBoCd0QQAvD_BwE">Firebase console</a> and create a new project and obtain your own google-services.json file and paste it at app/src/debug to set it up and running.<br> For more information, please refer the <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup">docs</a>.
