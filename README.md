# Background Story
I started coding the original WallR Android App in the second year of my college in 2016. In the next 6 months, I was able to somewhat finish it and release it on the play store. Although it did not have a maintainabe codebase, it had a pretty sleek UI which is why I was able to garner a good number of users and a huge number of crashes! Fast forward to 2018 and I find myself struggling in this huge pile of unmaintainable code, trying to fix crashes, when I understood the value of a good codebase. Thus, I decided to rewrite the app again from scratch with proper app architecture, coding guidelines, SOLID principles and unit tests. <br>
And here I present, WallR 2.0, tested, easily maintainable and scalable.
